This is a team project for the Blockchain course, in which we implemented a Auction Application based on NFTs.

As a user you can create an NFT, mint it, create an auction for it, and let the other users start bidding. When the auction is finished, you will get the highestBidders ETH and transfer the ownership of the NFT.
